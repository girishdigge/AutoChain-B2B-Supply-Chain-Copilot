# üîß WebSocket Immediate Disconnect Fix

## Issue Analysis ‚úÖ

**Status**: Connections are **accepted** but **immediately disconnect**
**Pattern**: Connect ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Disconnect ‚Üí Reconnect loop

## Root Cause Investigation

### What's Working ‚úÖ

- WebSocket endpoint is correct (`/ws/test-client-123`)
- Backend accepts connections (no more 403 errors)
- Connection establishes successfully

### What's Failing ‚ùå

- Connections close immediately after opening
- Causes reconnection loop
- Both frontend and Postman have same issue

## Potential Causes

### 1. Heartbeat/Ping Issue

The frontend sends ping messages that the backend might not handle correctly.

**Fix Applied**: Disabled heartbeat temporarily

```typescript
heartbeatInterval: 0, // Disable heartbeat temporarily
```

### 2. Message Protocol Mismatch

The frontend might be sending messages in a format the backend doesn't expect.

### 3. Backend WebSocket Handler Issue

The backend WebSocket handler might be closing connections for some reason.

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test with Debug Tool

Open: `http://localhost:4173/websocket-debug.html` (or your preview URL)

- Click "Test Connection"
- Watch the logs for detailed connection info
- Check close codes and reasons

### 2. Restart Frontend

```bash
# If using dev server
npm run dev

# If using preview
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### 3. Check Close Codes

- **1000**: Normal close (expected)
- **1006**: Abnormal close (connection lost)
- **Other codes**: Protocol or server issues

## Expected Results After Fix

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:

- Connection stays open longer than 1-2 seconds
- No immediate reconnection attempts
- Backend logs show stable connections
- Debug tool shows successful message exchange

### ‚ùå If Still Failing:

Try these additional fixes:

#### Fix 1: Simplify Connection

```typescript
// In WebSocketContext.tsx, change to:
const realSocket = usePortiaSocket({
  url: import.meta.env.VITE_WS_BASE || 'ws://localhost:8000/ws',
  clientId: state.websocket.clientId,
  autoConnect: !state.mockMode,
  reconnectAttempts: 1, // Reduce reconnection attempts
  reconnectDelay: 5000, // Increase delay
  heartbeatInterval: 0, // Keep disabled
});
```

#### Fix 2: Check Backend Logs

Look for any error messages when connections close.

#### Fix 3: Test with Different Client ID

Change in `.env`:

```
VITE_CLIENT_ID=simple-client
```

## Verification Commands

```bash
# 1. Check if frontend is using new config
grep -n "heartbeatInterval" frontend/src/context/WebSocketContext.tsx

# 2. Test with curl (if backend supports it)
curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Key: test" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" http://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/test-client

# 3. Monitor backend logs for patterns
# Look for any error messages when connections close
```

The heartbeat disable should resolve the immediate disconnection issue.

# 🔧 Final Tailwind CSS Fix Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed Circular Dependency**

- **Problem**: `transition-fast` class was used in `@apply` directive within `.interactive-scale`
- **Solution**: Replaced `transition-fast` with actual Tailwind utilities: `transition-all duration-150 ease-out`

### 2. **Removed Unused Custom Classes**

- **Removed**: `.transition-fast` and `.transition-slow` classes
- **Reason**: These were only defined but never used, and could cause circular dependency issues

### 3. **Fixed Invalid Outline Utility**

- **Problem**: `outline-ring/50` is not a valid Tailwind utility
- **Solution**: Removed the invalid utility from the base layer

## 🚀 Build Status: READY

The build should now complete successfully without any Tailwind CSS errors.

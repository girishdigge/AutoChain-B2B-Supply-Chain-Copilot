# ðŸ”§ React 19 Preview Fix

## Issue Identified âœ…

**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'useLayoutEffect')`
**Cause**: React 19 compatibility issue with Vite build configuration

## Fix Applied âœ…

Updated `vite.config.ts` with React 19 compatibility settings:

- Added `jsxRuntime: 'automatic'` to React plugin
- Added React JSX runtime to optimized dependencies
- Added global definition for production builds

## Next Steps

### 1. Clear Build Cache & Rebuild

```bash
# Clear any cached builds
rm -rf dist/
rm -rf node_modules/.vite/

# Rebuild with new configuration
npm run build
```

### 2. Test Preview

```bash
npm run preview
```

### 3. If Still Issues, Try Clean Install

```bash
# Clear everything and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules/
rm -rf dist/
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Expected Result

- âœ… No more `useLayoutEffect` errors
- âœ… Application loads correctly in preview
- âœ… All React components render properly

## Alternative Solution (If Above Doesn't Work)

If the issue persists, we can downgrade React to a more stable version:

```bash
npm install react@^18.3.1 react-dom@^18.3.1
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Verification

After the fix, you should see:

- Preview server starts successfully
- Application loads without console errors
- All functionality works as in development mode

# Workflow Active State & Serial Execution Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Steps Not Showing Active State**

**Problem**: Steps were jumping straight from `pending` to `completed`, skipping the `active` state
**Root Cause**: Aggressive auto-completion logic was immediately marking steps as completed
**Fix**: Removed aggressive auto-completion, only complete workflow on explicit final events

### 2. **Skipped Steps Not Marked as Completed**

**Problem**: In serial execution, when a step is skipped, it should be marked as completed
**Root Cause**: No logic to handle serial execution flow
**Fix**: Added serial execution logic to complete previous steps when new step starts

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Aggressive Auto-Completion**

```typescript
// BEFORE: Auto-completed workflow when all steps seemed done
if (completedStepsCount === totalStepsCount && mappedStatus === 'completed') {
  // Auto-complete workflow
}

// AFTER: Only complete on explicit final events
// Don't auto-complete to preserve active state visibility
```

### 2. **Enhanced Serial Execution Logic**

```typescript
// When a new step starts as 'active':
if (mappedStatus === 'active') {
  // 1. Complete any currently active step (only one should be active)
  const activeStepIndex = updatedSteps.findIndex(
    (step) => step.status === 'active'
  );
  if (activeStepIndex >= 0 && activeStepIndex !== currentStepIndex) {
    // Complete the previous active step
    updatedSteps[activeStepIndex].status = 'completed';
  }

  // 2. Mark any pending steps before current as completed (skipped)
  for (let i = 0; i < currentStepIndex; i++) {
    if (updatedSteps[i].status === 'pending') {
      updatedSteps[i].status = 'completed'; // Mark as skipped
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. **Proper Final Completion Handling**

- Workflow only completes when `processing_completed` event is received
- `final_output` event properly marks remaining steps as completed
- No premature auto-completion based on step counts

## Expected Behavior Now

### âœ… **Active State Visibility**

1. Step starts â†’ Shows as `active` (blue, spinning icon)
2. Step completes â†’ Shows as `completed` (green, checkmark)
3. Next step starts â†’ Previous step completes, new step becomes active

### âœ… **Serial Execution Flow**

1. **Normal Flow**: pending â†’ active â†’ completed
2. **Skipped Steps**: pending â†’ completed (when next step starts)
3. **Only One Active**: At most one step is active at any time

### âœ… **Proper Completion**

1. Individual steps complete when backend sends completion event
2. Workflow completes only when `processing_completed` event received
3. No premature auto-completion

## Visual States

| Status      | Color  | Icon      | Description            |
| ----------- | ------ | --------- | ---------------------- |
| `pending`   | Gray   | Clock     | Waiting to start       |
| `active`    | Blue   | Spinning  | Currently executing    |
| `completed` | Green  | Checkmark | Finished successfully  |
| `failed`    | Red    | X         | Failed with error      |
| `waiting`   | Orange | Clock     | Waiting for user input |

## Testing

1. **Start New Workflow**: Steps should show as `pending` initially
2. **Watch Progression**: Each step should show as `active` when running
3. **Check Completion**: Steps should show as `completed` when done
4. **Verify Serial Flow**: Only one step should be `active` at a time
5. **Skipped Steps**: Should show as `completed` when next step starts

The workflow should now properly show the active state and handle serial execution correctly! ðŸŽ‰
